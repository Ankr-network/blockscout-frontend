# Redirections

If you need to add a redirection rule for [http://www.ankr.com/](http://www.ankr.com/) create a PR to the [aws-redirection-rules.json](aws-redirection-rules.json) file. However it doesn't works instantly and the rules should be applied manually by an engineer who has permissions for it.
