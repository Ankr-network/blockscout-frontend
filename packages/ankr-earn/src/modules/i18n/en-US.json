      "answer-5": "You receive the unstaked amount of AVAX after the end of the current validating period. A validating period is 4 weeks.",
      "question-6": "How do I receive rewards?",
      "answer-6": "aAVAXb is a rebasing token. When holding aAVAXb, your balance will increase in proportion to your AVAX staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So each day, you will see the quantity of your aAVAXb increase by a small amount.<br/><br/>aAVAXc is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. Instead, it appreciates in value, as the redemption ratio grows because of reward accumulation.",
      "question-7": "How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?",
      "answer-7": "aAVAXb will increase in number with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily. aAVAXc rewards are built into the token. Effectively, your rewards accumulate daily as aAVAXc grows in value to AVAX.",

      "question-10": "If I click Unstake, does my stake immediately stop accumulating rewards?",
      "answer-10": "Your stake <b>continues</b> to accumulate rewards until the moment you receive them.",
      "question-11": "Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?",
      "answer-11": "The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction, attacks the network, or goes offline. The delegated staked AVAX is not slashed — slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.",

      "question-3": "Why do I get less aBNBc than aBNBb for my 1 BNB?",
      "answer-3": "aBNBb is a rebasing token that changes in number, which is why we decided 1 aBNBb is equal to 1 BNB. However, aBNBc only changes in value, which is why the amount of aBNBc you get when staking is calculated by the formula <code>stake * exchange_ratio</code>. The exchange ratio is calculated like this: <code>totals_supply_of_abnbc / (total_staked_bnb + total_rewards_for_staked_bnb - total_unstaked_abnbb_and_abnbc)</code>.",

      "question-8": "Does Ankr charge for the service?",
      "answer-8": "ANKR does not charge any service fees for BNB Liquid Staking. However, validators charge a delegate stake fee, representing an indirect cost for liquid staking token holders: Ankr validator charges 2% from the rewards, BNB48 Club validator charges 0.48% from the rewards.",

      "question-9": "What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aBNBb or appreciation of aBNBc?",
      "answer-9": "Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to and how much BNB is validated on the network. The less BNB is staked, the higher the rewards to incentivize more BNB to come online, and vice versa. Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.",

      "question-10": "Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?",
