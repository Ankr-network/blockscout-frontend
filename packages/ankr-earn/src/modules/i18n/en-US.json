      "question-4": "How do I receive rewards?",
      "answer-4": "aAVAXb is a rebasing token. When holding aAVAXb, your balance will increase in proportion to your AVAX staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So every day, you can see that the quantity of your aAVAXb has increased by a small amount.",
      "question-5": "How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?",

      "question-7": "What determines the amount of rewards that I receive through rebase?",
      "answer-7": "Staking rewards depend mostly on how long your staked AVAX is locked. Ankr Earn splits the total staking amount between two nodes with a lock period of 56 days with a time shift of 28 days from one another.<br/><br/>aAVAXb holders will therefore get the average staking rewards of all staked AVAX through Ankr Earn and ability to unstake any tyme with an unbonding period not more than 28 days.",
      "question-8": "Is there any risk from Liquid staking, like slashing or any penalties?",
      "answer-8": "The only risk for stakers is reducing out on rewards if Validator node users are offline 20% of the time relative to other Validator nodes.<br/><br/>However, staked AVAX will not be slashed.

      "question-3": "Why do I get less aBNBc than aBNBb for my 1 BNB?",
      "answer-3": "aBNBb is a rebasing token that changes in number, which is why we decided 1 aBNBb is equal to 1 BNB. However, aBNBc only changes in value, which is why the amount of aBNBc you get when staking is calculated by the formula <code>stake * exchange_ratio</code>. The exchange ratio is calculated like this: <code>totals_supply_of_abnbc / (total_staked_bnb + total_rewards_for_staked_bnb - total_unstaked_abnbb_and_abnbc)</code>.",

      "answer-6": "aBNBb is a rebasing token. When holding aBNBb, your balance will increase in proportion to your BNB staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So each day, you will see the quantity of your aBNBb increase by a small amount. <br/>aBNBc is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking.

      "question-8": "Does Ankr charge for the service?",
      "answer-8": "ANKR does not charge any service fees for BNB Liquid Staking. However, validators charge a delegate stake fee, representing an indirect cost for liquid staking token holders: Ankr validator charges 2% from the rewards, BNB48 Club validator charges 0.48% from the rewards.",
      "question-9": "What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aBNBb or appreciation of aBNBc?",
      "answer-9": "Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to and how much BNB is validated on the network. The less BNB is staked, the higher the rewards to incentivize more BNB to come online, and vice versa. Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.",
      "question-10": "Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?",
      "answer-10": "The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is ‚Äúin jail‚Äù (slashed). Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction or goes offline. The delegated staked BNB is not slashed ‚Äî slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator.

      "title": "FAQ",
      "question-1": "What is Polygon (MATIC) liquid staking?",
      "answer-1": "Polygon Liquid Staking offers instant liquidity for your staked MATIC. When you stake MATIC, you will mint and claim aMATICb tokens. These new tokens can be used with DeFi platforms to earn additional layers of rewards.",
      "question-2": "What is the minimum amount of MATIC I can stake?",
      "answer-2": "The minimum amount you can stake is {value} MATIC.",
      "question-3": "How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?",
      "answer-3": "Your aMATICb balance will increase daily with every rebase. This rebase reflects the staking rewards you have earned for the period.",
      "question-4": "How do I receive rewards?",
      "answer-4": "The aMATICb tokens you keep in your wallet will gradually increase in quantity to reflect the staking rewards you earn. This happens daily with a process called ‚Äúrebasing‚Äù (adjusting the supply of tokens) to deliver your appropriate staking rewards.",
      "question-5": "What determines the amount of reward I receive with each rebase?",
      "answer-5": "This depends on the average staking period of Ankr Earn validator nodes, as well as MATIC total supply and size of the future instant liquidity pool (an indirect cost for aMATICb holders).",
      "question-6": "If I unstake, is there a lead time required for this to happen, or is it immediate?",
      "answer-6": "You will need to wait for a period of around 3-4 days. This is because the blockchain needs to undergo 80 ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù to process this transaction.",
      "question-7": "Are there any docs about the MATIC staking and how I set up my wallet etc.?",
      "answer-7": "Yes, you can access a more in-depth user guide <a href=\"https://docs.ankr.com/earn/liquid-staking/polygon\">here.</a>"

      "answer-1": "Yes ‚Äì there‚Äôs a user guide you can find <a href=\"https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask\">here</a>.",
      "question-2": "What is the minimum amount of FTM I can stake?",
      "answer-2": "{value} FTM",
      "question-3": "What is the unstaking period of aFTMb?",
      "answer-3": "The unstaking period is a maximum of {days} days. Every {days} days, there is at least one validator node reaching the end of its locking period. The cost of unstaking aFTMb can vary depending on the availability of FTM in the closest maturing node to avoid any liquidity risk.",
      "question-4": "How do I receive rewards?",
      "answer-4": "aFTMb is a rebasing token. When holding aFTMb, your balance will increase in proportion to your FTM staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So every day, you can see that the quantity of your aFTMb has increased by a small amount.",
      "question-5": "How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?",
      "answer-5": "Your aFTMb balance will increase with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily.",
      "question-6": "Does Ankr charge for this service?",
      "answer-6": "Ankr does not charge any service fees for Fantom Liquid Staking. However, validators charge a delegate stake fee of 15%, representing an indirect cost for liquid staking token holders. Ankr's income comes from running one of the several validator nodes that will be used to stake FTM.",
      "question-7": "What determines the amount of rewards that I receive through rebase?",
      "answer-7": "Staking rewards depend mostly on how long your staked FTM is locked with Ankr Earn. <br/>Staking FTM without locking provides approximately 4.5% rewards, or about 14% when locking for 365 days. You can find the most updated information about FTM staking rewards by locking period <a href=\"https://fantom.foundation/ftm-staking/\">here</a>. <br/>Ankr will aim to delegate 50% of staked FTM for the maximum possible period (approx. 1 year), 25% for 28 days, and 25% for 56 days. <br/>aFTMb holders will therefore get the average staking rewards of all staked FTM through Ankr Earn.",
      "question-8": "Is there any risk from Liquid staking, like slashing or any penalties?",
      "answer-8": "If a validator node acts maliciously, delegators will also be slashed as this is an essential part of the Fantom network‚Äôs security. Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.",
      "question-9": "Is there liquidity for aFTMb anywhere currently?",

      "question-4": "Is there a maximum amount I can stake?",
      "answer-4": "No, you can stake at your discretion, unlimited. You should know that currently staking starts once 32 ETH are accumulated, so if your stake is >32 ETH, it‚Äôll be divided into chunks and the rule will apply to each of them.",
      "question-5": "What is the unbonding period for aETHb/aETHc?",

      "question-6": "How do I receive rewards?",
      "answer-6": "aETHb is a rebasing token. When holding aETHb, your balance will increase in proportion to your ETH staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So each day, you will see the quantity of your aBNBb increase by a small amount. <br/>aETHc, though, does not change in quantity but will appreciate in value, daily. <br/>Mind that to pull out your rewards, you‚Äôll need to sell aETHb/aETHc on Ankr DeFi, as Ethereum hasn‚Äôt implemented the unstaking functionality yet.",
      "question-7": "How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?",
      "answer-7": "aETHb will increase with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily. aETHc will increase in value only, daily.",
      "question-8": "Does Ankr charge for the service?",
      "answer-8": "ANKR does not charge any service fees for ETH Liquid Staking. However, validators charge a fee deducted from your rewards (Ankr‚Äôs validator node charges 10%), representing an indirect cost for liquid staking token holders. Ankr's income comes from running one of the several validator nodes that will be used to stake ETH.",
      "question-9": "What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aETHb or appreciation of aETHc?",
      "answer-9": "Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to and how much ETH is validated on the network. The less ETH is staked, the higher the rewards to incentivize more ETH to come online, and vice versa. Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards. View the <a href=\"https://launchpad.ethereum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">current amount of staked ETH</a>.",
      "question-10": "Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?",
      "answer-10": "The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is slashed. Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction or goes offline. The delegated staked ETH is not slashed ‚Äî slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.",
