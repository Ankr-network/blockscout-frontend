      "question-4": "How do I receive rewards?",
      "answer-4": "aAVAXb is a rebasing token. When holding aAVAXb, your balance will increase in proportion to your AVAX staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So every day, you can see that the quantity of your aAVAXb has increased by a small amount.",

      "question-7": "What determines the amount of rewards that I receive through rebase?",

Ankr Staking splits the total staking amount between two nodes with a lock period of 56 days with a time shift of 28 days from one another.<br/><br/>aAVAXb holders will therefore get the average staking rewards of all staked AVAX through Ankr Staking and ability to unstake any tyme with an unbonding period not more than 28 days.",
      "question-8": "Is there any risk from Liquid staking, like slashing or any penalties?",

      "question-3": "Why do I get less aBNBc than aBNBb for my 1 BNB?",
      "answer-3": "aBNBb is a rebasing token that changes in number, which is why we decided 1 aBNBb is equal to 1 BNB. However, aBNBc only changes in value, which is why the amount of aBNBc you get when staking is calculated by the formula <code>stake * exchange_ratio</code>. The exchange ratio is calculated like this: <code>totals_supply_of_abnbc / (total_staked_bnb + total_rewards_for_staked_bnb - total_unstaked_abnbb_and_abnbc)</code>.",

      "answer-6": "aBNBb is a rebasing token. When holding aBNBb, your balance will increase in proportion to your BNB staking rewards. A rebase runs daily, and rewards occur each time this runs. So each day, you will see the quantity of your aBNBb increase by a small amount. <br/>aBNBc is a reward-bearing token, meaning its quantity stays the same from the moment of staking. Instead, it appreciates in value, as the redemption ratio grows because of reward accumulation.",

      "question-7": "How soon after staking will I begin to receive rewards?",
      "answer-7": "aBNBb will increase in number with every rebase; rebasing occurs daily. aBNBc will increase in value, daily.",

      "question-8": "Does Ankr charge for the service?",
      "answer-8": "ANKR does not charge any service fees for BNB Liquid Staking. However, validators charge a delegate stake fee, representing an indirect cost for liquid staking token holders: Ankr validator charges 2% from the rewards, BNB48 Club validator charges 0.48% from the rewards.",

      "question-9": "What determines the amount of reward I receive each rebase of aBNBb or appreciation of aBNBc?",
      "answer-9": "Staking rewards depend mostly on the voting power of the validator node that your stake is delegated to and how much BNB is validated on the network. The less BNB is staked, the higher the rewards to incentivize more BNB to come online, and vice versa. Ankr aims to spread delegations to only the most trustworthy and reliable nodes to increase staking rewards.",

      "question-10": "Is there any risk from staking, like slashing or any penalties?",
      "answer-10": "The only risk for stakers is missing out on rewards during any time a validator they staked with is “in jail” (slashed). Slashing is a protocol-level penalty associated with a validator failure if it validates an invalid transaction or goes offline. The delegated staked BNB is not slashed — slashing impacts only the self-stake of the validator. Ankr only delegates to trusted and reputable validator nodes to avoid any validator that would act maliciously.",
