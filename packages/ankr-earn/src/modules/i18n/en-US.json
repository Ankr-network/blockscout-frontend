      "info": "Some ANKR Delegated Staking users recently encountered problems when staking, and a number of these issues are difficult to resolve with our existing staking architecture. To ensure we have a lasting solution to give our users a better experience, we've decided to rework the architecture of the staking contract while putting it through another security audit.<br /><br />In addition to solutions provided by the new architecture, we have managed to significantly reduce the price of transactions when claiming rewards, restaking, and unstaking. We will also enable unstaking a fraction of funds in addition to the entirety.<br /><br />To use the new version of ANKR Delegated Staking, you will need to send a migration transaction. Once the transaction is sent, your rewards will be auto-claimed and your staked funds will be safely migrated to the new version. Feel free to send the transaction any time, your staked assets will continue accumulating rewards even if not migrated. The cost of the migration transaction is around the cost of a reward-claiming transaction, so you won't overspend. Unfortunately, you won't be able to see your staking or rewards stats before you migrate.<br />Ready to migrate now?",
