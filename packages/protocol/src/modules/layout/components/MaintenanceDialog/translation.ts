      'We have some planned maintenance work coming this Monday, June 3. It <strong>won’t</strong> impact interacting with Web3 API, but it <strong>will</strong> impact logging into your account, accessing Statistics, or working with<br />Billing.<br /><br />The sad part is that some of your Statistics data for the maintenance period will be lost. We’re truly sorry but can’t do anything about it — be strong.<br /><br />Before Monday, ensure you have enough API Credits in your account to sustain your uninterrupted calls during the maintenance hours.',
